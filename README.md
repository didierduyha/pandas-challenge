Module 4 Challenge - pandas Challenge

## Description
We are given two .csv files that contain data about 15 different schools and another that contaion 39,170 different students with their math and reading scores. The code combines these two datasets and looks at both high level summaries of the data (_i.e._, total budgets, total students, passing rates) to a more in depth summaries (_i.e._, passing rates by school, passing rates by size, etc.).

## Usage
This is used to provide both a general understanding of the schools metrics AND provide a look into the impact of certain school metrics on student performance, specifically, passing rates for the subject of math and reading. Focusing on the latter (impact on scores), understanding the effect of certain metrics provides insight and direction in how schools and school systems can be improved to better serve students and help them succeed.
